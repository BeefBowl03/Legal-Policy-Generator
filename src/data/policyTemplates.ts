/**
 * POLICY TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
 * ============================
 * 
 * This file contains all the policy templates and the logic to generate dynamic HTML
 * based on user input. Here's how it works:
 * 
 * 1. TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
 *    - Each template is defined as a PolicyTemplate object with id, name, description, and htmlTemplate
 *    - Templates use placeholders like [Your Company Name] that get replaced with actual data
 * 
 * 2. DYNAMIC DATA REPLACEMENT:
 *    - The generatePolicyHTML function replaces all placeholders with actual form data
 *    - Placeholders are mapped to PolicyData fields (e.g., [Your Company Name] â†’ policyData.legalBusinessName)
 *    - Smart fallbacks are provided when data is missing (e.g., 'N/A' or default values)
 * 
 * 3. AUTOMATIC LINK CONVERSION:
 *    - Email addresses automatically become mailto: links
 *    - Phone numbers automatically become tel: links  
 *    - URLs automatically become clickable links with target="_blank"
 * 
 * 4. AVAILABLE TEMPLATES:
 *    - Shipping Policy: Complete shipping policy with delivery times, costs, and procedures
 *    - Billing Terms: Complete billing terms with payment methods, late fees, and subscription details
 *    - Cookie Policy: Complete cookie policy with tracking technologies and user consent information
 *    - Disclaimer: Comprehensive legal disclaimers and limitations of liability
 *    - Payment Options: Complete payment methods, security measures, and transaction procedures
 *    - Return and Refund Policy: Complete return and refund policy with timelines, conditions, and procedures
 *    - Privacy Policy: Comprehensive privacy policy with data collection, usage, and protection information
 *    - Terms of Service: Comprehensive terms of service with user rights, responsibilities, and legal obligations
 * 
 * 5. CUSTOMIZATION:
 *    - Add new templates by creating a new PolicyTemplate object
 *    - Add new placeholders to the replacements mapping in generatePolicyHTML
 *    - Modify styling by updating the CSS in the htmlTemplate strings
 * 
 * 6. USAGE:
 *    - Import generatePolicyHTML and pass a template + PolicyData
 *    - The function returns fully rendered HTML with all placeholders replaced
 *    - Use the returned HTML in your application or export to files
